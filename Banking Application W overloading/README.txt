The Code preforms the following Operations:

Write a C++ program that simulates a banking application by 
defining a base class Account and derived classes SavingsAccount, 
CheckingAccount, and FixedDeposit. Each derived class should implement its 
own method for calculating interest: calculateInterest for savings accounts at 
a 4% interest rate, for checking accounts at a 1% interest rate, and for fixed 
deposits at a 7% interest rate per year. Overload the calculateInterest function 
to take objects of these different account types and return the calculated 
interest. In the main function, create instances of each account type, display 
their details, and calculate the interest using the overloaded functions. 
Implement appropriate constructors and methods to handle account balance 
and term (for fixed deposits).

Thanks :-D
