The Code preforms the following Operations:

Write a C++ program that defines template functions for adding 
and multiplying two values of different types. Additionally, implement a 
decision function that first checks if the second number is less than the first 
number. If the condition is met, perform both addition and multiplication 
operations using the previously defined functions; otherwise, display a 
message indicating that no operations were performed. Modify the main
function to prompt the user for input values and use the decision function to 
determine and execute the appropriate operations based on the input.

Thanks :-D
