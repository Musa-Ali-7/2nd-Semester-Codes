The Code preforms the following Operations:

Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of friend classes 
to access a private constructor. Define a class Secret with a private constructor 
and a public method show. Declare a second class FriendClass as a friend of 
Secret to allow it to create instances of Secret. Implement a method in 
FriendClass that returns an instance of Secret. In the main function, create an 
instance of FriendClass, use it to create an instance of Secret, and call the 
show method of the Secret instance to verify that the private constructor was 
successfully accessed.

Thanks :-D
