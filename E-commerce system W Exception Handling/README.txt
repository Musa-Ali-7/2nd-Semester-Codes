The Code preforms the following Operations:

Write a C++ program that simulates an e-commerce system by 
defining a Product class with attributes for product name, price, quantity, and 
description. Implement methods to display product details and manage the 
product quantity. Create an Order class derived from Product that includes an 
attribute for the order quantity. Ensure the order quantity is valid and update 
the product's available quantity accordingly, throwing exceptions for invalid 
values. In the main function, create an instance of the Order class, display the 
order and product details, and handle any exceptions related to invalid input 
values
